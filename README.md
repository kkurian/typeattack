**Type fast. Type well. Type to survive.**

The future of programming: Start multiple AI assistants working on different code. Disconnect. They keep working. Reconnect from anywhere.

Three skills make this possible:
1. **Touch typing** — Type without looking at the keyboard. As fast as you think.
2. **Keyboard-driven workflows** — Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between AIs.
3. **Persistent sessions** — Keep your AIs running even when you disconnect for awhile.

Those skills are for using tools thst have names (vim, tmux, mosh) but forget that. What matters is building the muscle memory. Like riding a bike—impossible until it clicks, then automatic forever.

There is no talent. There is only practice. Welcome to the dojo.

## Play online

**[https://kkurian.github.io/typeattack/](https://kkurian.github.io/typeattack/)** *(launching soon)*

## Play offline

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkurian/typeattack.git
cd typeattack
open index.html
```

## What you'll master

1. **Typing** — Build muscle memory for the keyboard
2. **Vim** — Learn the motions that make you fast
3. **Tmux/Mosh** — Master persistent sessions

## How it works
