**Type fast. Type well. Type to survive.**

The future of programming: Start multiple AI assistants working on different code. Disconnect. They keep working. Reconnect from anywhere.

Three skills make this possible:
1. **Touch typing** — Type without looking at the keyboard. As fast as you think.
2. **Keyboard-driven workflows** — Use keyboard shortcuts instead of clicking with a mouse. Way faster.
3. **Persistent sessions** — Your AIs stay running even when you disconnect. When you reconnect, everything is exactly where you left it.

These tools have names (vim, tmux, mosh) but forget that. What matters is building the muscle memory. Like riding a bike—impossible until it clicks, then automatic forever.

There is no talent. There is only practice. Welcome to the dojo.

## Play online

**[https://kkurian.github.io/typeattack/](https://kkurian.github.io/typeattack/)** *(launching soon)*

## Play offline

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkurian/typeattack.git
cd typeattack
open index.html
```

## What you'll master

1. **Typing** — Build muscle memory for the keyboard
2. **Vim** — Learn the motions that make you fast
3. **Tmux/Mosh** — Master persistent sessions and unstable connections

80% proficiency at one level umlocka the next. Your progress saves in your browser.
