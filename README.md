**Type fast. Type well. Type to survive.**

The future of programming: Start multiple AI assistants working on different code. Disconnect. They keep working. Reconnect from anywhere.

Three skills make this possible:
1. **Touch typing** — Type without looking at the keyboard. As fast as you think.
2. **Keyboard-driven editing** — Edit code with keyboard shortcuts instead of clicking with a mouse. Way faster.
3. **Persistent sessions** — Your terminal stays running on a server when you disconnect. All your AI agents keep working. When you reconnect, everything is exactly where you left it.

These tools have names (vim, tmux, mosh) but forget that. What matters is building the muscle memory. Like riding a bike—impossible until it clicks, then automatic forever.

There is no talent. There is only practice. Welcome to the dojo.

## Play

**[https://kkurian.github.io/typeattack/](https://kkurian.github.io/typeattack/)** *(launching soon)*

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kkurian/typeattack.git
cd typeattack
open index.html
```

That's it. No npm. No build. Just open and play.

## How It Works

1. **Typing** — Build muscle memory for the keyboard
2. **Vim** — Learn the motions that make you fast
3. **Tmux/Mosh** — Master persistent sessions and unstable connections

Each level unlocks at 80% proficiency. Your progress saves locally.

## Tech

Pure vanilla JavaScript. Zero dependencies. Runs anywhere.
