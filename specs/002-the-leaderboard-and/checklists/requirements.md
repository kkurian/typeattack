## Notes

- All checklist items passed on initial validation
- Specification is based on extensive discussion of anti-cheat mechanisms and user identity system
- Key design decision: "Proof of play" authentication where users must play the game to earn voting/feedback privileges
- System uses hash-based deduplication to prevent replay attacks
- Community moderation through voting system eliminates need for manual administration
